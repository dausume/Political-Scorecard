### What are Serializers, De-Serializers, and Mixins in this context of Springboot?
These are the different methods for modifying how json is handled in the Springboot app.

## Serializers
Used to Serialize a JAVA object, converting it into json text.
JSON is one of the main formats data is sent in on the web, by defining our serializer we can specify
exactly what we want our json to look like when we hit an end-point for a particular object.

## De-Serializers
Used to De-Serialize JSON text recieved on an API (Controllers in SPringboot), converting the JSON text into
the given object.

## Mixins
Used to define additional customization onto how the Serializers and De-serializers work, such as when to
ignore particular variables conditionally in json.
