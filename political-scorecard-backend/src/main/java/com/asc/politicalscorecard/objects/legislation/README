### Legislative accountability data-structure
This section is used for objects and file references meant for refining or doing accountability
work on traditional legislative documents, or for performing attribution tying fragments of documentation
to structured contexts and scoring.

This section also acts as a means to allocate scores to historic actions to establish a baseline of studying
historically how certain policies and implementation approaches have performed.
